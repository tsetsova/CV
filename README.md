## Ina Tsetsova

An artist turned coder with a dedication to good craftsmanship and beautiful clean code.

Being at Makers Academy was an intense, exhausting and exhilarating experience, pairing and sweating over code every single day. Now that it's over, I would like to join an organisation where I can continue to learn and create better code than the week before. I thrive when I work in an inspired, imaginative and friendly community - I learn faster, achieve more and bring the most value.

## Skills

#### Fast Learner

I learn new concepts quickly, and enjoy applying them in new and challenging situations.

- At Makers Academy, I had to use a new language or framework almost every week. Because of this, I now have a clearer idea of the steps I need to take to be able to use a new language comfortably. For example, when learning Javascript, I knew it was best for me to start using it on little projects, not only to follow tutorials. So I rewrote a program I'd written in Ruby a few weeks before. It was very satisfying to redo something that initially took a couple of days in a completely new language and only in a couple of hours.
- In my previous role, I learned how to code emails responsively on the job, and started working on client projects within the first couple of weeks. This was a very different type of front-end coding that what I'd been used to, since I came from a more traditional website HTML/CSS background. I needed to learn the technical limitations of email, adapt to different email clients and devices, and work with other people's code
- After university I taught myself how to draw on paper and digitally, and even recorded a course teaching others drawing skills on Skillshare (380 students currently enrolled).


#### Team Player

Being an excellent communicator and working well with people has been essential in my career.

- As a campaign manager at Profusion I collaborated with our clients and internal teams to create and deliver bespoke and timely campaigns for companies such as M&S Bank and HSBC. I often advised non-technical clients, managed expectations and handled technical difficulties/delays.
- During my employment at Yieldify, I liaised with Sales, Tech, Design and Account teams to come up with the best tailored solution for every client's on-site and email campaigns across desktop, tablet and mobile.
- At Makers Academy, I paired with a new person every day and learned to discuss code, but also how to question and be questioned, how to give and receive feedback. In my last two weeks at Makers, I was a part of a team of four, building a study planner for online courses. We learned to break our project down into user stories and spread the workload between each other with Waffle and Git Flow to remain organized and accountable.
